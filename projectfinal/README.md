# CMSC389E Spring 2025: Final Project
Nathan Ho

## What did your program aim to accomplish?

My program aimed to calculate and display all the triangle numbers that can be computed in an 8-bit system.

## How long did it take to run

At 100 instructions per second in the simulator, under 10 seconds.

## Did you run into any problems? If so, how did you solve them?

The number display was not working in-game (for some unknown reason), so I just used the simulator.

## Verification

I did verify that my program works. I have included a video, which you can find here:
